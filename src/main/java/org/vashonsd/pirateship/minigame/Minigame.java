 * The Minigame interface describes the behaviors of anything that can work as a Minigame in our world.
 * 
 * Minigames are like processes that run within the main process of the game. Once the Player decides to 
 * Run a minigame, the text commands are now piped into the Minigame and consumed there.
 * 
 * This means that Minigames need to be able to quit gracefully, returning an exit message. They cannot
 * grab control of the interface and never let it go.
