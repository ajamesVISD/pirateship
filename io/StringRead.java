 * This is a simplified version of the built-in Java StringReader interface, which has more methods for
 * reading and parsing and gracefully shutting down results.
 * 
 * Future versions may want to read Strings, or []bytes, or even whole objects. The Java interfaces can
 * handle those, they're just more complex.
 * 
 * Notice this interface could be implemented by a file reader, or something that reads a stream from a
 * network, or whatever you want.
